            <hr class="short">

            <p class="intro-p"> I am an Ottawa Valley raised, sport playing, hell raisin’ kinda gal. Nothing beats a great bonfire and a couple beers with some good friends (except for netflix, sometimes netflix wins).</p>

            <p class="intro-p">I played competitive sports since I can remember. (It may be because any game in my house was a competitive one, but that’s for a later time). Basketball was my game but I dabbled in football, badminton, volleyball, track, and swimming and anything else I may be able to win. Sports taught me that a little teamwork and some good competition make for a deadly combination.</p>

            <p class="intro-p bottom-p">I am an opinionated, optimistic, brutally honest, proud Canadian  designer with a passion to push the limits. I am me.
